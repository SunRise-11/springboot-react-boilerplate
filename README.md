# spring-react-boilerplate

*NOTE:* `create-react-app` support is a WIP! To work it needs to changes to
CRA that are not neither merged nor released. This branch will not work for
you if you try to use it.

An example application that uses a Spring Java backend with a React
frontend.

## Another Boilerplate?

Yes, but with Java. It's inspired by the
[spring-react-isomorphic](https://github.com/sdeleuze/spring-react-isomorphic)
project, but uses:

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for installing Node modules.
- [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) to bundle all the
  JavaScript and dependencies, plus LESS + CSS handling.
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for ES6 syntax, using Babel 6 with the "es2016" and "react" presets.
- [Hot module reloading
  (HMR)](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr) of React components
- [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) to manage state, both in the
  client and when rendering on the server.
- [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) for page routing,
  on client and server. Note that this is version 4, with a very different (and
  simpler) API to previous versions.
- [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) for managing
  meta-data in the HTML
- Linting integrated with Webpack via [eslint](https://github.com/MoOx/eslint-loader).
- Type checking with [Flow](https://flowtype.org/).

## Other Goodies

You also get:

- [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) to cut down the Java
  boilerplate
- [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) to serialize model data
  before rendering on the server. For more information, see
  [this OpenJDK thread on the subject](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/nashorn-dev/2013-September/002006.html),
  but summary is Nashorn won't (and actually can't) string-ify POJOs via
  `JSON.stringify`, meaning it can't be used to serialise the Redux state.

## Caveats

This isn't necessarily the best way to write a React application. Pull requests welcome!

## Running the code

Execute `mvn` if you have Maven already installed, or `./mvnw` if you don't. You'll need
[Java8 installed](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) either way at
a minimum version of `1.8.0_65`. Older versions have a bug that makes rendering
brutally slow.

Run Webpack in hot-module reloading mode with: `npm start`.

## Conventions

Controllers that render views are suffixed with `Controller`. REST endpoints are
suffixed with `Resource`, and handle requests under `/api`.

## Testing the Webpack bundle

In order to preempt runtime errors with Nashorn loading the bundle, a test
script is executed by Maven during the `test-compile` phase, located at
`src/test/js/test_bundle.js`. If this script fails, you can diagnose the problem
by:

* Running a debug build with `npm run debug`. This runs Webpack in a production
  mode but without uglification.
* Run the script again: `jjs src/test/js/test_bundle.js`
* Look at the line in the bundle from the stacktrace and figure out the problem.

It's easy to create a bundle that's broken on the server by including code that
expects a DOM - and that includes the Webpack style loader. This is the root of
most problems. You should note that server-side rendering *does not* require a
DOM - which is why `src/main/resources/static/js/polyfill.js` doesn't provide
any `window` or `document` stubs.

## The `render` function

We implement a customer render function for Spring to call. The source code
is in `render.es6.js`, and is compiled to ES5 syntax during the Maven
build.
